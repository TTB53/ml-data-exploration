Machine Learning Data Exploration
---
***

Originally written for my MBA data science project in the Fall 2019. We had to use data 
gathered from the internet to help a fictitious business. After searching on Kaggle, I landed on 
a Marijuana (Cannabis) Dataset. I took this a step further and developed a Flutter Mobile App to serve
the chosen model.

I decided to upload what I used to do my exploratory analysis, and the model I developed that and possibly 
expand on it with 2021 skills and model techniques.


## Application Purpose

***
To understand the data after processing, visualize the columns of interest, train a variety of machine
learning models, and choose the best one based on the fictitious businesses needs.


## Lessons Learned

***

1. Data prep and exploration
2. Training and Testing Machine Learning Model
